# NLP_Final_Project
This is Brandon McHenry's final project for Data Quality & Web Text Mining at Rowan University.

This project was created using Python 3.11.4

Warning: Any corpora you load will be downloaded to your computer. This will take up a variable amount of storage (100s of MBs - 10s of Gbs). Also note, if you do not have the resulting files from running the program at least one time, the process of translating the different versions of the text takes a significant amount of time. If you wish to completely recreate the process of analyzing and translating the corpus I used (korean_hate_speech), then please be patient.
